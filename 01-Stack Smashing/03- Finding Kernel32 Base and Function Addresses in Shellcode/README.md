# Finding Kernel32 Base and Function Addresses in Shellcode

The purpose of this lab is to understand how shellcode finds kernel32 base address in memory of the process it's running in and then uses to find addresses of other functions that it requires in order to achieve its goal. 
In this lab I will write some assembly to find the kernel32 dll's base address, resolve **WinExec** function address in memory and call it to open **calc.exe**.

# Finding Kernel32 Base Address
It's well known that shellcode usually leverages the following chain of internal Windows OS memory structures in order to resolve the kernel32 base address which I am going to walk through in WinDBG:

```bash
TEB->PEB->Ldr->InMemoryOrderLoadList->currentProgram->ntdll->kernel32.BaseDll
```
