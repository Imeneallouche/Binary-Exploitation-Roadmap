# Calling Conventions

To be able to call functions, there needs to be an agreed-upon way to pass arguments. If a program is entirely self-contained in a binary, the compiler would be free to decide the calling convention. However in reality, shared libraries are used so that common code (e.g. libc) can be stored once and dynamically linked in to programs that need it, reducing program size.

In Linux binaries, there are really only two commonly used calling conventions:
```yaml
cdecl: for 32-bit binaries
SysV : for 64-bit binaries
```

# cdecl

In 32-bit binaries on Linux, function arguments are passed in **on the stack in reverse order**. A function like this:
```c
int add(int a, int b, int c) {
    return a + b + c;
}
```
would be invoked by:
```
pushing c, then b, then a.
```

# SysV
For 64-bit binaries, function arguments are first passed in certain registers:
```yaml
first : RDI
second: RSI
third : RDX
fourth: RCX
fifth : R8
sixth : R9
```
then any leftover arguments are pushed onto the stack in reverse order, as in cdecl.
